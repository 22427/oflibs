   TRACK : Tracking
================================================================================
   This is basically an API to the ART network data stream. The data send by
   the ARTDTrack2 is received, and provided in one easy to use class.

___API__________________________________________________________________________
   Just create an TrackingData object. From here on you can ask the objekt of
   the current state of all tracked targets.
   After calling the method start() the object spawns a thread to handle the
   communication with the DTrack2 server. All public methods are save to call
   any time. You can use the setTransformation(...) method to set a
   transformation that  will be  applied to all positions and orientations.

   There are different methods to acces different types of targets:
   -get3ds()	returns all 3DoF-targets found in the last frame.
   -get6d(id)	returns the selected 6DoF-Target*.
   -get6di(id)	returns the selected Dtrack2-Internal-6DoF-Target*.
   -getFlystick(id) retunrs the selected Flystick*.
   * If there is no information a Corresponding Target Object will be returned,
   located in (0,0,0). If there are no new informations about a Target the last
   knonw Information is returned.
