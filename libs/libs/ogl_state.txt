	OGL_STATE: OpenGL State
================================================================================
	This is a state tracking class, which also provides some stock shaders and
	functions.

		State tracking:
		There is a matrix stack for modelview- and projection-matrix, and a state
		for	eight light sources. Just like in OpenGL 1.x

		Stock Shaders:
		There are shaders for texturing, phong shading and distance field alpha
		handling.

___Usage_______________________________________________________________________

	You need to specify an OpenGL header in as OFL_GL_HEADER. for example:

		#define OFL_GL_HEADER <glad/glad.h>
		#define OFL_GL_HEADER <glew.h>


		This module also uses GLM ... sorry I was too lazy to implement all
		these functions, and its not feasible anyway.


___API_________________________________________________________________________

	Matrix-Stacks:
	There are two stacks. PROJECITON and MODEL_VIEW. You can change which is
	modified using the matrixMode(...) method.
	with pushMatrix() and popMatrix() you can either push a copy of the top-most
	matrix onto the stack or pop the top-most matrix from the stack.
	All other matrix modifying methods effect the top-most(current)
	matrix of the selected stack:

	void loadIdentity();	sets the matrix as identity
	void translate(..);		translates the current matrix
	void rotate(...);		rotates the current matrix
	void scale(...);		scales the current matrix
	void lookAt(...);		multiplys the current matrix with a lookAt-matix
	void ortho(...);		multiplys the current matrix with a ortho-matix
	void frustum(...);		multiplys the current matrix with a frustum-matix
	void perspective(...);	multiplys the current matrix with a persp.-matix

	Lights:
	You can set Light parameters using the setLight*(...) methods.

	Stock-shaders:
	You can select different stock shaders by calling enable() or disable() for
	different features.
	The features are:
	- Texturing: Basic color mapping
	- Lighting: Basic per fragment lighting
	- DFAlpha: Iterpreting the Alpha channel as distance field.
	- NonStockShader: Use the set non stock shader. If this feature is
	Enabled all uniforms and attributes will still be set, but your shader
	will be used.
